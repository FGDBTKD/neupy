Basics
======

.. contents::

Layer is a building block for constructible neural networks. NeuPy has a simple and flexible framework that allows to construct complex neural networks.

Join layers
-----------

Let's start with basics. The most useful function to define relations between layers is ``layers.join``. It accepts sequence of layers and join them into the network.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from neupy import layers
    >>>
    >>> layers.join(
    ...     layers.Sigmoid(1),
    ...     layers.Sigmoid(2),
    ... )
    Sigmoid(1) > Sigmoid(2)
    >>>
    >>> layers.join(
    ...     layers.Sigmoid(2),
    ...     layers.Sigmoid(1),
    ... )
    Sigmoid(2) > Sigmoid(1)

Inline operator
---------------

Also, NeuPy provides a special **inline** operator that helps to define sequential relations between layers.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from neupy import layers
    >>>
    >>> network = layers.Sigmoid(2) > layers.Sigmoid(1)
    >>> network
    Sigmoid(2) > Sigmoid(1)

Input and output shapes
-----------------------

In the previous examples each layer accepted one argument that defines it's output shape, but there is no information about network's input shape.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from neupy import layers
    >>>
    >>> network = layers.Sigmoid(2) > layers.Sigmoid(1)
    >>> network
    Sigmoid(2) > Sigmoid(1)
    >>>
    >>> print(network.input_shape)
    None
    >>> network.output_shape
    (1,)

Network has two properties that provide information about network's input and output shape. In addition we can iterate through each layer in the network and check their input and output shapes.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from neupy import layers
    >>>
    >>> network = layers.Sigmoid(2) > layers.Sigmoid(1)
    >>>
    >>> for layer in network:
    ...     print(layer)
    ...     print('----------')
    ...     print('Input shape: {}'.format(layer.input_shape))
    ...     print('Output shape: {}'.format(layer.output_shape))
    ...     print()
    ...
    Sigmoid(2)
    ----------
    Input shape: None
    Output shape: (2,)

    Sigmoid(1)
    ----------
    Input shape: (2,)
    Output shape: (1,)

From the output we can clearly see that ``Sigmoid(1)`` layer has defined input and output shape. Input shape for the ``Sigmoid(1)`` layer has been provided by the ``Sigmoid(2)``, but ``Sigmoid(2)`` layer doesn't have any input connections and we know nothing about it's input shape. To be able to fix it we need to add the :layer:`Input` layer.

Input layer
-----------

The :layer:`Input` layer defines input shape for the network.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> network = layers.Input(3) > network
    >>>
    >>> for layer in network:
    ...     print(layer)
    ...     print('----------')
    ...     print('Input shape: {}'.format(layer.input_shape))
    ...     print('Output shape: {}'.format(layer.output_shape))
    ...     print()
    ...
    Input(3)
    ----------
    Input shape: (3,)
    Output shape: (3,)

    Sigmoid(2)
    ----------
    Input shape: (3,)
    Output shape: (2,)

    Sigmoid(1)
    ----------
    Input shape: (2,)
    Output shape: (1,)

The :layer:`Input` layer accepts one parameter that defines network's input shape. When we connected this layer to our previous network we defined input shape for the whole network.

Build networks from the code
----------------------------

You could have noticed that in the previous examples we was able to re-use previously defined network. In fact, we can simply construct network from the code.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from neupy import layers
    >>>
    >>> network = layers.Input(10)
    >>>
    >>> for size in (8, 6, 4, 2):
    ...     network = network > layers.Sigmoid(size)
    ...
    >>> network
    Input(10) > Sigmoid(8) > Sigmoid(6) > Sigmoid(4) > Sigmoid(2)

Code above is equivalent to the following code

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from neupy import layers
    >>>
    >>> network = layers.join(
    ...     layers.Input(10),
    ...     layers.Sigmoid(8),
    ...     layers.Sigmoid(6),
    ...     layers.Sigmoid(4),
    ...     layers.Sigmoid(2),
    ... )
    >>> network
    Input(10) > Sigmoid(8) > Sigmoid(6) > Sigmoid(4) > Sigmoid(2)

Mutlilayer Perceptron (MLP)
===========================

In this section we are going to learn more about layers with activation function which are the most important building blocks for the MLP networks. Let's consider the following example.

.. code-block:: python

    from neupy import layers

    network = layers.join(
        layers.Input(784),
        layers.Relu(500),
        layers.Relu(300),
        layers.Softmax(10),
    )

.. figure:: images/feedforward-graph-connection.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Feedforward connections in NeuPy

You can see from the figure above that each layer with activation function defines dense connection. In NeuPy you can define dense connections between layers within activation function for simplicity. We can separate layer into to other layers that apply simplier operations.

.. code-block:: python

    from neupy import layers

    network = layers.join(
        layers.Input(784),

        layers.Linear(500),
        layers.Relu(),

        layers.Linear(300),
        layers.Relu(),

        layers.Linear(10),
        layers.Softmax(),
    )

Network defined above has exactly the same architecture as the one in previous example. We just split each layer with activation function into simple operations. Operation in the ``layers.Relu(500)`` is equivalent to ``layers.Linear(500) > layers.Relu()``.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
===================================

NeuPy supports Convolutional Neural Networks. Let's consider the following example.

.. code-block:: python

    from neupy import layers

    convnet = layers.join(
        layers.Input((3, 28, 28)),

        layers.Convolution((32, 3, 3)),
        layers.Relu(),
        layers.Convolution((48, 3, 3)),
        layers.Relu(),
        layers.MaxPooling((2, 2)),

        layers.Reshape(),
        layers.Softmax(10),
    )

.. figure:: images/conv-graph-connection.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Convolutional Neural Network in NeuPy

There are a few new layers that we are going to explore in more details.

Reshape
-------

.. code-block:: python

    layers.Reshape()

This layer basically do the same as `numpy.reshape <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html>`_ function. The main different is that it has an optional argument that defines output shape. When shape is not defined :layer:`Reshape` layer converts input to 2D matrix.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from neupy import layers
    >>> connection = layers.Input((3, 10, 10)) > layers.Reshape()
    >>> connection.input_shape
    (3, 10, 10)
    >>> connection.output_shape
    (300,)

Also we can specify expected output shape as a parameters for the :layer:`Reshape` layer.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from neupy import layers
    >>> connection = layers.Input((3, 10, 10)) > layers.Reshape((3, 100))
    >>> connection.input_shape
    (3, 10, 10)
    >>> connection.output_shape
    (3, 100)

Convolution
-----------

.. code-block:: python

    layers.Convolution((32, 3, 3))

Each of the convolutional layers takes one mandatory argument that defines convolutional filter. Input argument contains three integers ``(number of filters, number of rows, number of columns)``. Information about the stack size takes from the previous layer.

NeuPy supports only 2D convolution, but it's trivial to make a 1D convoltion. We can for instance set up width eqaul to ``1`` like in the following example.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from neupy import layers
    >>>
    >>> layers.join(
    ...     layers.Input((10, 30)),
    ...     layers.Reshape((10, 30, 1)),
    ...     layers.Convolution((16, 3, 1)),
    ... )

Convolutional layer has a few other attributes that you can modify. You can check the :layer:`Convolutional <Convolution>` layer's documentation and find more information about its arguments.

Pooling
-------

.. code-block:: python

    layers.MaxPooling((2, 2))

Pooling layer has also one mandatory argument that defines a factor by which to downscale ``(vertical, horizontal)``. The ``(2, 2)`` value will halve the image in each dimension.

Pooling works only with 4D inputs, but you can use in case of 3D if you apply the same trick as we did it with convolutional layer. You need to define one of the downscale factors equal to ``1``.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from neupy import layers
    >>>
    >>> layers.join(
    ...     layers.Input((10, 30)),
    ...     layers.Reshape((10, 30, 1)),
    ...     layers.MaxPooling((2, 1)),
    ... )

Graph connections
=================

Any connection between layers in NeuPy is a `Directional Acyclic Graph (DAG) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph>`_. So far we've encountered only sequential connections which is just a simple case of DAG. In NeuPy we are allowed to build much more complex relations between layers.

.. code-block:: python

    from neupy import layers

    network = layers.join(
        layers.Input((3, 10, 10)),
        [[
            layers.Convolution((32, 3, 3)),
            layers.Relu(),
            layers.MaxPooling((2, 2)),
        ], [
            layers.Convolution((16, 7, 7)),
            layers.Relu(),
        ]],
        layers.Concatenate()

        layers.Reshape(),
        layers.Softmax(10),
    )

.. figure:: images/conv-parallel-connection.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Graph connections in NeuPy

You can see that we defined a list inside of the

You can see two new layers. The first one is the Parallel layer. This layer accepts two parameters. First one is an array of multiple connections. As you can see from the figure above each of the connections above accepts the same input, but each of the do different transformation to this input. The second parameter is an layer that accepts multiple inputs and combine then into single output. From our example we can see that from the left branch we got output shape equal to ``(32, 4, 4)`` and from the right branch - ``(16, 4, 4)``. The :layer:`Concatenate` layer joins layers over the firts dimension and as output returns tensor with shape ``(48, 4, 4)``.

Also its possible to define the same graph relations between layers with inline operator.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from neupy import layers
    >>>
    >>> left_branch = layers.join(
    ...    layers.Convolution((32, 3, 3)),
    ...     layers.Relu(),
    ...     layers.MaxPooling((2, 2)),
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> right_branch = layers.join(
    ...     layers.Convolution((16, 7, 7)),
    ...     layers.Relu(),
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> input_layer = layers.Input((3, 10, 10))
    >>> network = input_layer > [left_branch, right_branch] > layers.Concatenate()
    >>> network = network > layers.Reshape() > layers.Softmax()

Notice that we've used Python's list with NeuPy's inline operator. List helps us to define one to many relations

.. code-block:: python

    input_layer > [left_branch, right_branch]

and many to one

.. code-block:: python

    [left_branch, right_branch] > layers.Concatenate()

Compile Networks
================

Layers in NeuPy are build on top of a Tensorflow library. It means that all operations construct computational graph that we need to compile. NeuPy provides a simple function that allow to compile network into Python funciton.

.. code-block:: python

    from neupy import layers

    network = layers.join(
        layers.Input(10),
        layers.Relu(20),
        layers.Relu(4),
    )
    predict = network.compile()

Now we have function that propagates input through the network and returns obtained output from the network.

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from neupy import asfloat

    # Convert matrix to float
    x_test = asfloat(np.random.random((12, 10)))
    y_predicted = predict(x_test)

The ``compile`` method creates input variables automatically, but we are able to specify different input variables.

.. code-block:: python

    import theano.tensor as T

    x = T.matrix()
    predict = network.compile(x)

If network has more than one input we will be able to set up multiple inputs.

.. code-block:: python

    import theano.tensor as T
    from neupy import layers

    input_1 = layers.Input(10)
    input_2 = layers.Input(20)

    network = [input_1, input_2] > layers.Concatenate()

    x1 = T.matrix('x1')
    x2 = T.matrix('x2')

    predict = network.compile(x1, x2)

Also NeuPy provides flexibility to compile networks with Tensorflow API

.. code-block:: python

    import theano
    import theano.tensor as T
    from neupy import layers

    network = layers.join(
        layers.Input(10),
        layers.Relu(20),
        layers.Softmax(4),
    )

    x = T.matrix()
    # Compile prediction function
    predict = theano.function([x], network.output(x))

Network in NeuPy can be in two different states: training and non-training. Some functions like :layer:`Dropout` or :layer:`GaussianNoise` behave differently in different states. For instance, the :layer:`Dropout` layer in the training state disables some of the input values with certain probability, but do not apply this operation in non-training state. To be able to disable training state for the network we can use the ``disable_training_state`` method.

.. code-block:: python

    x = T.matrix()

    # Use Dropout during the prediction
    training_predict = theano.function([x], network.output(x))

    with network.disable_training_state():
        # Ignore Dropout during the prediction
        predict = theano.function([x], network.output(x))

.. raw:: html

    <br>

Set up inputs to the network
============================

There are a few ways to define inputs for the network. The simples one is just to pass an argument to the ``output`` method.

.. code-block:: python

    import theano
    import theano.tensor as T
    from neupy import layers

    network = layers.join(
        layers.Input(10),
        layers.Relu(20),
        layers.Softmax(4),
    )

    x = T.matrix()
    predict = theano.function([x], network.output(x))

In case if you pass only one argument and you have more than one input layer then the same input will be passed to each of the input layers. In case if you need to use different inputs to different layers you can specify them in order.

.. code-block:: python

    import theano
    import theano.tensor as T
    from neupy import layers

    input_10 = layers.Input(10, name='input-1')
    input_20 = layers.Input(20, name='input-2')
    network = [input_10, input_20] > layers.Concatenate()

    x1 = T.matrix('x1')
    x2 = T.matrix('x2')

    # Note that variables passed in specific order. Since
    # input_10 was created first then x1 will be first argument.
    predict = theano.function([x], network.output(x1, x2))

    # Also we can specify inputs as a dictionary
    y = network.output({'input-1': x1, 'input-2': x2})
    predict = theano.function([x], y)

    # Also we can specify inputs as a dictionary
    y = network.output({input_10: x1, input_20: x2})
    predict = theano.function([x], y)

All three ``predict`` functions in the previous examples are exactly the same. They just was defined in three different ways.

Use different input and output layers
=====================================

To be able to use different input and output layers you need to use ``start`` and ``end`` methods. Here is an example.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from neupy import layers
    >>>
    >>> network = layers.join(
    ...     layers.Input(10),
    ...     layers.Relu(20, name='relu-2'),
    ...     layers.Relu(30),
    ...     layers.Relu(40, name='relu-4'),
    ...     layers.Relu(50),
    ... )
    >>> network
    Input(10) > Relu(20) > Relu(30) > Relu(40) > Relu(50)
    >>>
    >>> network.end('relu-4')
    Input(10) > Relu(20) > Relu(30) > Relu(40)
    >>>
    >>> network.start('relu-2')
    Relu(20) > Relu(30) > Relu(40) > Relu(50)
    >>>
    >>> network.start('relu-2').end('relu-4')
    Relu(20) > Relu(30) > Relu(40)

In addition, it's possible to point into multiple input and output layers

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from neupy import layers
    >>>
    >>> network = layers.Input(10) > layers.Relu(20, name='relu-2')
    >>>
    >>> output_1 = layers.Relu(30, name='relu-3') > layers.Sigmoid(1)
    >>> output_2 = layers.Relu(40, name='relu-4') > layers.Sigmoid(2)
    >>>
    >>> network = network > [output_1, output_2]
    >>>
    >>> network
    10 -> [... 6 layers ...] -> [(1,), (2,)]
    >>>
    >>> network.end('relu-3', 'relu-4')
    10 -> [... 4 layers ...] -> [(30,), (40,)]

Also instead of using names we can specify layer instance

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from neupy import layers
    >>>
    >>> input_layer = layers.Input(10)
    >>> relu_2 = layers.Relu(20)
    >>> relu_3 = layers.Relu(30)
    >>>
    >>> network = input_layer > relu_2 > relu_3
    >>> network
    Input(10) > Relu(20) > Relu(30)
    >>>
    >>> network.end(relu_2)
    Input(10) > Relu(20)

.. raw:: html

    <br>

Find specific layer by name in the network
==========================================

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from neupy import layers
    >>>
    >>> network = layers.join(
    ...     layers.Input(10, name='input-1'),
    ...     layers.Relu(8, name='relu-0'),
    ...     layers.Relu(5, name='relu-1'),
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> network.layer('relu-0')
    Relu(8)
    >>>
    >>> network.layer('relu-1')
    Relu(5)
    >>>
    >>> network.layer('test')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    NameError: Cannot find layer with name 'test'

.. _subnetworks:

Subnetworks
===========

**Subnetworks** is a method that improves readability of the networks architecture. Instead of explaining it's much easier to show the main advantage of this method. Here is an example of the simpe convolutional network.

.. code-block:: python

    from neupy import layers

    connection = layers.join(
        layers.Input((1, 28, 28)),

        layers.Convolution((32, 3, 3)),
        layers.Relu(),
        layers.BatchNorm(),

        layers.Convolution((48, 3, 3)),
        layers.Relu(),
        layers.BatchNorm(),
        layers.MaxPooling((2, 2)),

        layers.Convolution((64, 3, 3)),
        layers.Relu(),
        layers.BatchNorm(),
        layers.MaxPooling((2, 2)),

        layers.Reshape(),

        layers.Relu(1024),
        layers.BatchNorm(),

        layers.Softmax(10),
    )

Does it look simple to you? Not at all. However, this is a really simple network. It looks a bit complecated because it contains a lot of simple layers that usually combined in one. For instance, non-linearity like :layer:`Relu` is usually built-in inside the :layer:`Convolution` layer. So instead of combining simple layers in one complecated in NeuPy it's better to use subnetworks. Here is an example on how to re-write network's structure from the previous example in terms of subnetworks.

.. code-block:: python

    from neupy import layers

    connection = layers.join(
        layers.Input((1, 28, 28)),

        layers.Convolution((32, 3, 3)) > layers.Relu() > layers.BatchNorm(),
        layers.Convolution((48, 3, 3)) > layers.Relu() > layers.BatchNorm(),
        layers.MaxPooling((2, 2)),

        layers.Convolution((64, 3, 3)) > layers.Relu() > layers.BatchNorm(),
        layers.MaxPooling((2, 2)),

        layers.Reshape(),

        layers.Relu(1024) > layers.BatchNorm(),
        layers.Softmax(10),
    )

As you can see we use an ability to organize sequence of simple layer in one small network. Each subnetwork defines a sequence of simple operations. You can think about subnetworks as a simple way to define more complecated layers. But instead of creating redundant classes that define complex layers you can define everything in place. In addition it improves the readability, because now you can see order of these simple operations inside the subnetwork.
